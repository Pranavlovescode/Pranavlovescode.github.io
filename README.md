# My Portfolio
Hey GitHub fam! I've just unleashed my first-ever website into the wild, and it's my very own portfolio! `https://github.com/Pranavlovescode/My-Portfolio`

**Here's the tech rundown:**

- **Front-end finesse:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript worked their magic to create a visually captivating experience. ✨
- **Backend brilliance:** While GitHub only hosts static sites, I've got a whole other repo brimming with backend code that brings my portfolio to life. ⚙️ **Check it out here:** [Insert link to your backend code repo]

**Come explore, tap those emojis, and let me know what you think!    I'm eager for feedback, high fives, and maybe even a few collabs with fellow code enthusiasts.  #portfoliolaunch #githublove #fullstackadventure**
